# CleanYourTV for LG webOS: briefing for AI assistants

> **This repository is a fork** of `lasharor/cleanyourtv-WebOS` for one TV, and is not upstream. Read `FORK-NOTES.md`
> before acting: it names the TV, the firmware, how to reach it, how to publish a release from this repo, and how to
> install onto that TV. Where `FORK-NOTES.md` is more specific than this file, it wins — in particular rule 7 below:
> in *this* repository you are the maintainer, so tagging and releasing is allowed when the user asks for it.

Read this first when you help someone with this project, either to find out what is wrong on their TV or to fix a bug in the code.
The full documentation is in `docs/` (published at https://lasharor.github.io/cleanyourtv-WebOS/); the page for you is `docs/ai.md`.

## What it is

A launcher that replaces LG's Home on a **rooted** LG webOS TV, plus a root service on the TV: Live TV from the user's own playlist, an Inputs
list on the remote's Input key, picture notifications, optional voice, themes, a debloat of LG's ads, and a manager app that sets up,
updates and removes everything. Everything is applied at boot with mounts in RAM; nothing under `/usr`, `/etc` or the firmware is changed on
disk, and a reboot without the boot scripts brings LG's Home back.

## Where things are

| Symptom or feature | Look at |
|---|---|
| The launcher page (home screen, menus, Live TV player) | `app/index.html` (one file, ES5 style, no framework) |
| The root service: API, usage, foreground tracking | `helper/helper.js` (port 8765, loopback only) |
| The manager app and its API (updates, options, keys) | `manager/app/index.html`, `helper/manager.js`, `helper/selfupdate.js` |
| The Input key, the Inputs list over the running app | `helper/inputhook.js`, `helper/picker.js`, `picker/app/`, `scripts/inputkey.sh` |
| Home takeover at boot, rollback, undo | `scripts/10-cleanyourtv-home`, `scripts/stage-home.sh`, `scripts/undo-home.sh`, `scripts/bootstrap.sh` |
| Live TV: playlist, guide, favourites | `helper/live.js` and the Live TV part of `app/index.html` |
| Picture notifications | `notify/app/`, `helper/notify.js`, `helper/notifyapi.js` |
| Voice (Moonshine, OpenRouter, Home Assistant) | `helper/voice.js`, `voice/` |
| Themes | `helper/theme.js` (the schema), `themes/` (read from GitHub), `docs/themes.md` |
| The report people attach to issues | `helper/sharelog.js` (`node sharelog.js --print` prints it) |
| Node 8 compatibility helpers, diagnostics | `helper/netcompat.js`, `helper/diag.js` |
| Build and checks | `ipk/build.py`, `tools/node8-check.js`, `tools/node8-check.sh` |

## Facts about the TV that matter

- Test TV: LG OLED65G26LA, webOS 25 (SDK 10), Node.js 16. **webOS 5 and 6 have Node.js 8.12** and an older Chromium (68 on webOS 5, 79 on
  webOS 6). The userland is 32-bit ARM on a 64-bit kernel.
- The root filesystem, `/usr` and `/etc` are read-only. Writable: `/media/developer`, `/var`, `/tmp`. Use bind mounts, never write into `/usr`.
- Where things are on the TV: `/media/developer/cleanyourtv/` (service files, `config.json`, `app/`, `live/`, `themes/`, `backup/`),
  `/var/lib/webosbrew/init.d/` (boot scripts, run by the Homebrew Channel), `/media/developer/cytv-setup.log` (setup log),
  `/tmp/cleanyourtv-helper.log` (service log), `/tmp/lginput-hook-lginput2.log` (input hook).
- Root SSH works with a key (`ssh root@<tv-ip>`). `luna-send` must have stdin redirected: `luna-send -n 1 -w 5000 -f <uri> '<json>' </dev/null`.
- The service listens on `127.0.0.1:8765` (use `curl` on the TV). Other ports: 8766 Live TV pairing, 8767 network notifications (opt-in),
  8768+ share log, 8769 voice setup. The last four are short-lived or off by default.
- Going back to LG's Home: manager app > CleanYourTV as Home off, or `sh /media/developer/cleanyourtv/undo-home.sh`. If a boot crashes,
  the Homebrew Channel's failsafe mode skips the boot scripts.
- A TV's own state can be the problem: a stuck media pipeline (black video, no sound) is cleared by a reboot; check
  `luna://com.webos.media/getActivePipelines` before blaming the code.

## Rules

1. **Do not touch the user's TV without being asked.** Start read-only (`tools/diagnose.sh`, the report, `ps`, `cat`, `luna-send` queries).
   Propose every change (restart, edit, install, delete) and wait for a yes, and name the command that undoes it. Never reboot, uninstall,
   delete files or change boot scripts on your own.
2. **Never put private data in the repository, an issue or a pull request:** no playlist addresses, access keys, tokens, IP addresses,
   user or device names, webhook addresses. Mask them. `tools/diagnose.sh` and Share log already mask what they can; read the output.
3. **The service must run on Node.js 8.12** (webOS 5/6): no `??`, `?.`, `fs.rmSync`, `fs.cpSync`, `mkdirSync({recursive})`, `crypto.randomInt`,
   `fs.promises`, global `URL`, `http.get(url, options)`, and no `timeout` option on child processes (use `diag.execFile`). Use
   `helper/netcompat.js`. **The pages are written for Chromium 68 and up**: ES5 style, only transform and opacity animate (the GPU is weak),
   no flex `gap` without the polyfill the build adds.
4. **A fix needs a test** in `tools/node8-check.js` when it can be tested without a TV, and it must pass under Node 8.12:
   `sh tools/node8-check.sh` (downloads Node 8.12.0 once, checksum pinned). Say plainly what was checked on a real TV and what was not.
5. **Documentation must match the code.** Change the page in `docs/` when behaviour changes, and the README if it is mentioned there.
6. **Licence:** the project is MIT. Do not copy code from GPL projects; describe behaviour and write your own.
7. **Do not release, tag, force-push or change repository settings.** The maintainer does that. Work on a branch; every branch push publishes a
   test build (a pre-release named `test-<branch>`) that people can install from the manager app (Update channel).

## Commands

```sh
sh tools/node8-check.sh            # the service under Node 8.12.0 (also: node tools/node8-check.js)
python3 ipk/build.py               # writes dist/: the package and the launcher bundle with .sha256 files
node tools/theme-docs.js           # regenerates the settings table in docs/themes.md from helper/theme.js
node tools/theme-index.js          # writes themes/index.json
node tools/theme-preview.mjs <id>  # renders a theme in headless Chrome (Node 22+)
sh tools/diagnose.sh <tv-ip> > cytv-diagnose.txt   # read-only report from a TV over SSH
```

## Things that have gone wrong before (check these first)

- A hidden overlay app can keep the remote (webOS 6.5); the Input key then starts the picker on demand and closes it. The `running` list of
  the app manager lags by seconds after a start or close: do not make decisions from one reading.
- Closing from the page (`window.close`, `PalmSystem.hide`) does nothing on some builds: the service closes apps with
  `applicationManager/closeByAppId`.
- Node's `timeout` option on child processes is avoided on purpose (a `uv_close` assertion on Node 8); use `diag.execFile`. After an abnormal
  exit the next start logs the last operations (`/tmp/cytv-run.json`); they appear in the report.
- `bootstrap.sh` copies only `helper/*.js` and `scripts/*` to the TV. Anything else the service needs must be copied there too, or be read
  from somewhere else (themes are read from GitHub for that reason).
- Update checks and downloads must always end: a dropped connection emits `aborted` on the response, not an error on the request.
- webOS 5's Chromium can leave old text in the compositor when a list is redrawn: the launcher swaps elements instead of rewriting them.
- Themes are data; a theme must never contain CSS or script. The schema in `helper/theme.js` is the only source of what a theme can set.
