# Themes

A theme changes how the home screen looks: colours, the size of tiles and text, the number of columns, the clock, the ambient glow,
the speed of animations and a wallpaper. Themes apply to the launcher's home screen (dock, top shelf, grid, top buttons and menus).
Live TV, the Inputs picker and the notification cards keep their own look.

In the manager app, **Theme** lists the themes with a screenshot and a description of the highlighted one. Choosing one applies it; the
home screen shows it the next time you open Home. **Theme options** holds the **Accent colour** (the colour of the focus ring and of the
highlighted button or menu row, on top of any theme) and **Go back to the previous theme**.

## Where the themes come from

Themes are not part of the service. They are read from the [`themes/`](https://github.com/lasharor/cleanyourtv-WebOS/tree/main/themes)
folder of the GitHub repository (the `main` branch):

- The manager downloads `themes/index.json` (the list) and the screenshots when you open **Theme**.
- Choosing a theme downloads its `theme.json` and its wallpaper to the TV (`/media/developer/cleanyourtv/themes/<id>/`) and keeps them,
  so it keeps working offline. Choosing it again downloads the latest version. If GitHub cannot be reached, the list shows the themes
  that are already on the TV and says why.
- **Classic** is built into the service and always works.
- A theme is data only (values, an image): the service checks every value, limits the file sizes (theme 32 KB, wallpaper 1.5 MB,
  screenshot 600 KB) and checks that the images are images. There is no script or CSS in a theme.

## The themes

| Theme | What it is |
|---|---|
| Classic | The original look: near-black, white focus, ten columns. The default. |
| Midnight | Deep blue with a wallpaper and a blue focus. |
| OLED black | Pure black and no ambient glow, so unlit pixels stay off. |
| Warm | Brown and amber, with the glow in the accent colour and a wallpaper. |
| Compact | Twelve columns of smaller tiles: more apps on screen. |
| Large print | Eight columns of big tiles and larger text. |
| Still | No animation and a quiet glow. |
| Bloom | A flower wallpaper with the dock in a glass panel at the bottom. Down moves the dock up and the apps appear below it, centred. |
| Hero | Your TV input large and live (sound while it has the focus), the rain forecast and your Home Assistant lights beside it, and the other dock apps and Plex On Deck in one row below. Extends Lift. |
| Lift | Wide 16:9 tiles, five to a row, that lift with a shadow when focused, the app's name in small text under it, a nature photo behind them that changes every few hours, Plex On Deck above the dock (Customise > Plex to sign in) and the Inter typeface. Down moves the row up and the apps appear below it. |

## Contributing a theme

Themes live in the repository, so a new one is a pull request:

1. Copy a folder from [`themes/`](https://github.com/lasharor/cleanyourtv-WebOS/tree/main/themes), for example `classic`, to `themes/<id>/`.
   The id is lower-case letters, digits and `-`.
2. Edit `theme.json`; the rest keeps its default, or the value of the theme named in `"extends"`.
3. Add `preview.jpg`: a screenshot of the home screen with your theme (16:9, about 800 px wide, at most 600 KB). The TV shows it in the
   theme list.
4. If it uses a wallpaper, add the image to the same folder (`.jpg`, `.png` or `.webp`, at most 1.5 MB, 1920 x 1080) and name it in
   `effects.wallpaper`. A wallpaper must be your own work or under a licence that allows redistribution; say which in the pull request.
5. Run `node tools/theme-index.js` to update `themes/index.json`, then `node tools/node8-check.js`: it checks every theme folder against the
   schema, that the screenshot is there, and that the index is up to date.
6. Open the pull request. Once it is merged into `main`, every TV can download the theme; no release is needed.

When you add a setting to the engine, add one row to `SCHEMA` in `helper/theme.js`, read its variable in `app/index.html`, and run
`node tools/theme-docs.js` to regenerate the table below.

## Making a theme with an AI assistant

An assistant such as Claude can write a theme from a description ("a calm blue theme with big tiles and the dock at the bottom"). Give it a
checkout of the repository (or these files) and the rules below.

**What it needs to read**
- The table of settings further down this page (or `SCHEMA` in `helper/theme.js`, the source of that table): every key, its range and its default.
- `themes/classic/theme.json` and one existing theme that is close to the goal, for example `themes/bloom/theme.json`.
- `themes/README.md` for the folder layout.

**Rules**
- A theme is data only: `themes/<id>/theme.json` with keys from the table, nothing else. No CSS, no script, no URLs. Unknown keys and
  out-of-range values are ignored or clamped, so a value that is not in the table has no effect.
- Positions and sizes are pixels on a 1920 x 1080 canvas. Keep the clock and the buttons at least 60 px from the screen edges (TVs can
  crop the picture), and make sure the dock fits: `dock.count` x `dock.w` plus the gaps must be at most the screen width (a panel adds
  `dock.panelPad` on each side).
- Text must stay readable: about 4.5 : 1 between `colors.ink` and the surfaces it sits on, and a visible focus ring. The text colour on the
  accent is chosen automatically.
- The TV's graphics chip is weak: no blurred or animated wallpapers, one static image at most, 1920 x 1080, at most 1.5 MB (`.jpg`,
  `.png` or `.webp`), kept in the theme's folder and named in `effects.wallpaper`. Prefer the dock and grid settings over tricks.
- A wallpaper must be original (drawn or generated for the theme) or under a licence that allows redistribution. Do not copy other
  people's artwork, screenshots or logos, and do not use brand names or trademarks in a theme.
- Use `"extends"` to start from another theme and list only what changes. Do not rename a setting group: `name`, `author`, `description` and
  `extends` are the theme's own fields.

**Steps**
1. Create `themes/<id>/theme.json` (and the wallpaper, if any).
2. Look at it: `node tools/theme-preview.mjs <id> --out /tmp/preview` renders the home screen with made-up apps in headless Chrome and writes
   `rest.png` (home), `grid.png` (the focus moved down into the apps) and `menu.png` (a menu). It needs Node.js 22 or newer and Chrome. Open
   the images, fix what looks wrong (overlapping parts, unreadable text, clipped tiles) and render again.
3. When it looks right, `node tools/theme-preview.mjs <id> --write` also writes `themes/<id>/preview.jpg` (needs `ffmpeg`), the screenshot the TV shows.
4. `node tools/theme-index.js` updates `themes/index.json`; `node tools/node8-check.js` checks every theme folder, the screenshot and the index.
5. Commit and open a pull request; say where the wallpaper comes from.

**A prompt to start with**

> Create a theme for CleanYourTV. Read the settings table in `docs/themes.md`, `themes/classic/theme.json` and `themes/bloom/theme.json`.
> The theme: *describe the look and the layout you want*. Write `themes/<id>/theme.json` using only keys from the table (data only; ranges
> are enforced), generate an original wallpaper if it needs one (1920 x 1080, under 1.5 MB, saved in the theme's folder), render it with
> `node tools/theme-preview.mjs <id> --out /tmp/preview`, look at `rest.png`, `grid.png` and `menu.png`, fix problems and render again, then
> run `node tools/theme-preview.mjs <id> --write`, `node tools/theme-index.js` and `node tools/node8-check.js`. Keep text readable and the
> wallpaper my own work.

## Theme files

A theme is `themes/<id>/theme.json` in the repository. Every key is optional.
A missing or invalid value keeps the value of the theme named in `"extends"`, or the default, which is the original look, so a
theme lists only what it changes. Positions and sizes are in pixels on a 1920 x 1080 canvas.

```json
{
  "name": "Midnight",
  "author": "CleanYourTV",
  "description": "Deep blue with a soft wallpaper and a blue focus.",
  "extends": "classic",
  "colors": { "night": "#060a18", "panel": "#101830", "ink": "#eaf0ff", "accent": "#7aa2ff" },
  "effects": { "glow": 0.8, "wallpaper": "midnight.jpg", "wallpaperDim": 0.25 }
}
```

### What a theme can set

Every part of the home screen has its own position and size, so themes can arrange the screen differently, not only recolour it:
the **clock**, the top **buttons** (`bar`), the large app **name**, the **dock** and the **grid**. Each can be anchored to the top
or bottom edge and aligned left, centre or right, with an offset. A dock at the bottom turns the grid into an overlay that opens
when the focus moves down into it (Back or Up closes it); a dock at the top leaves the grid below it, scrolling.

A theme file holds values only. The service checks every value against the table and clamps numbers to their range; there is no CSS
and no script, and a wallpaper is accepted only as a plain file name from the theme's folder that is also a real image of the
right type. Anything else is ignored. The launcher draws the wallpaper once and nothing blurs or filters it, because the TV's GPU is weak.

From a shell on the TV:

```sh
curl localhost:8765/api/theme/list
curl -X POST localhost:8765/api/theme/set -d '{"id":"midnight","accent":"#ff8a3d"}'   # downloads the theme if it is not on the TV
curl -X POST localhost:8765/api/theme/revert
```
